## Project Motivation

Small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) are the lifeblood of the economy, bringing innovation, jobs, and local character to communities everywhere. But there's a harsh reality: in the world of cybersecurity, SMEs are often seen as the “weak links.” Cybercriminals know that smaller businesses tend to have fewer resources for security, making them attractive targets. In fact, the number of cyberattacks targeting SMEs has been steadily rising, with hackers looking to exploit weaker defenses and steal valuable data.

This guide aims to help turn the tables. We’re here to show that just because a business is small doesn’t mean it has to be vulnerable. With a combination of smart, practical security practices and AI-powered tools, SMEs can significantly strengthen their defenses. By automating threat detection, quickly responding to incidents, and anticipating potential risks, small businesses can keep their operations safe from bad actors who underestimate them.

The goal is to empower SMEs to not only keep pace with an evolving threat landscape but to stay one step ahead. Cybersecurity doesn’t have to be overwhelming or out of reach; with the right approach, it can be manageable and even a competitive advantage.
